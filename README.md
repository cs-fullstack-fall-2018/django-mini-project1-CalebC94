# django-mini-project1

Create an entirely new project from stratch. Make a site that will display the blog entries from your SQLite database. The attributes in your blog site should be title, entry, and date. DO NOT use other students as help until they are finshed with their project. Use instructions provided by the tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/.

Extra work:
Create a different page that will post entries to the site.

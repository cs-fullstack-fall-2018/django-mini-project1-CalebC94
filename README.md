# django-mini-project1

THIS IS A SOLO PROJECT.

CodeCrew need a website to record the teaching time for each teacher to import it into an invoicing system. To do this, create an entirely new project from stratch. Make a site that will display and add time card entries from your SQLite database. The attributes that can be entered in your timecard site should be name, school, subject, hours, and date.

Exercise 1: Use the admin portal to add entries. On the homepage, show all entries in the database.

Exercise 2: Create a different page that will use a form and post entries to the database.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> use other students as help until they are finshed with their project. Use instructions provided by the tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/.
